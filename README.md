# Wifi DoorBell
I am often not inside the house and won't hear the bell when someone is at the door. 
To get notified on my cellphone I could have bought a wifi doorbeel but I had some stuff laying around that could solve the problem.
As a chat/messaging app I use Telegram, Telegram allows you to create a bot and send messages to it via an API. The steps are easy to find in the Telegram documentation

### Hardware used for the project
- ESP-01 Arduino Wifi module 
- 18650 battery cell
- USB charger BMS for the 18650
